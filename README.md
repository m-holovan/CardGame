Design and implement an application for learning words of some language with flashcards.
 
(In our case) Flashcard – is a card with word\phrase\sentence in some foreign language on the front and 
translation on the back. Flashcards are used to memorize words by making decks (sets) of cards on the 
topic and exercising with them with some intervals.
For example, the user takes the deck “Animals”, selects random N cards and goes through them one-byone. On each card if user remembers the translation, they skip the card and go to next one. If user 
struggles to recall the translation, they look at the back of the card to see the translation.
Examples of such applications:
- Anki App 
- Tinycards
